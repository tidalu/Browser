# Introduction to Dev Tools

## History of DevTools

  - Mac: `Command+Option+C`
  - Windows, Linux, Chrome OS: `Control+Shift+C`

### Checking the Value

- If you want to check the value of something, use the `alert` function in the console.

## A wal through the panels

### Note

- Chrome extensions often mess with the DevTools data, leading to inaccurate reporting! If you're going to run any important audits, make sure you have all of your extensions disabled or use an Incognito tab!

### Panels

#### Elements üß™

- View and interact HTML and CSS
  - we can double click on the HTMl elements and edit the element and also in one click we can see the Styles,
    we can change the value, we can also change the property itself
  - we can add another css properties, by clicking on the ‚ûï on the right top of the DevTools on _Styles_ subPanel
  - we can even Drag and Drop the HTMl element

#### Network üåê

- View all files sent from the server
  - Mainly what we see when we refresh the page while on the _Network_ panel, we can see stack of all the requests sent
  - we hit the server and the server always gives index.html, which is on the top of the stack reqs, named **About** and type is _document_
  - the browser goes through html, and if there any refs to another files or servers it place these also to the stack after each other, like could be css, js , or anything
  - we can actually diagnose alot of cool things, including server issues all from the _Network_ panel of the DevTools
- Measure page load performance
  - we can alo check the each files time tool to load, and main two most need times: `DomContentLocaled: ...ms` and `Load: ...ms` on the bottom of the DevTools
- Watch your site load in real-time
  - we can watch it by clicking on the setting cog of the _Network_ panel, and enable capture screenshots , and we can see the every part of loading , like HTMl comes not styled, so on so on we can see all such stuff in real time
- Inspect request/response data
  - when aminly we are working on site project with some APIs , when it is not working, they will often ask data about headers sent either by the API od to the API
  - we can see the headers on by clicking on the any needed from the stack , and go to the _Headers_ sub panel, and we can see pretty much thighs like
