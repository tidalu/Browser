## Bachground

- We don't have a definition for web apps
  W3C have different definitions for different APIs
  There are many concepts around:

  - **hide/minimize**: in memory and with
    some execution rights
  - **suspend/freeze**: in memory
    with no execution rights
  - **close/kill/discard**: not in memory
    We will try to simplify it

- **Background:** when the user
  stops or pauses the usage of
  the web app

## Web app life cycle

- User goes to a new tab
- User goes to a new window
- User minimizes the window
- User closes the window
- User closes the browser or PWA
